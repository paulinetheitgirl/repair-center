### About

In this workshop, we will be using React and Redux to create web app for a repair center. Customer can visit the web app and log a ticket about the repairing devise, including its category, model and issue description.

### Requirements

The owner of the repair center has requested to build the web app with some sort of intelligence â€” based on what customer answered previously, the next set of questions should change dynamically.

Example flow is like this:
